# fizzbuzz-cli
A CLI for [Phoenix FizzBuzz](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/phoenix-fizzbuzz)'s JSON API.

It's very simple to use: just download the `fizzbuzz` binary, put it somewhere in your machine and execute it. The only catch is, you need to have a running API on your localhost:4000.

Linux and Mac are supported.
